# Traffic Redirector
Traffic Redirector is a simple Burp extension which helps you to redirect
certain network traffic or only specific requests sent by Burp tools. It does
so by providing a proxy and a HTTP listener which allow you to redirect e.g
one specific request to another server or redirect all traffic from one
specific domain to another.
